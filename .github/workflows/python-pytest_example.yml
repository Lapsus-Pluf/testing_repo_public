# This workflow will be triggered on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.
#   But it will only install Python dependencies and run Pytest tests (using a variety of Python versions)
#   if modifications are made to the `python-pytest_example` directory.
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python
